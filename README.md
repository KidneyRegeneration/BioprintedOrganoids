This repository is for single cell RNA sequencing analysis related to Lawlor, Vanslambrouck, Higgins, et al, Nature Materials, 2020
Imaging analysis is in repository BioprintedOrganoids-imaging.

All data needed to replicate the single cell RNA seq analysis is at :

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE152014

Each of the conditions, Ratio0 ('dots'), Ratio40 ('line'), Man ('hand') has an associated set of CellRanger output matricies containing the mRNA data as well as a set of Cite-seq-Count output matricies containing the hashing data.
